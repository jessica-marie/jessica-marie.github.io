<h3>Why are you interested in working with App Inventor? Please answer in at most 50 words.</h3>
<p>Before starting college I toured MIT Media Lab and loved all the projects. Then as a teacher I saw the value of Scratch and AppInventor. Now I would like to combine my technical and my education skills to help many more teachers and students than I can from my classroom.</p>
<h3>What experience do you have, if any, with teaching computer programming to beginners (including experience teaching about App Inventor)? Please describe this in at most 50 words.</h3>
<p>Starting as a college student I received a grant from NCWIT to create and implement a program to teach middle school girls to code. Since then I have taught 3 years as a full-time high school teacher and included AppInventor in my AP Computer Science Principles Curriculum.</p>
<h3>What would you like to work on this summer? You can select a project from the ideas list or propose your own project. If you do propose your own project, explain why this should be a priority for App Inventor development.</h3>
<p>Testing and Documentation: I would love to work within AppInventor to ensure that we are following and teaching only the highest standard of testing and documentation. On the more technical side, I want to work on Selenium Testing of the App Inventor UI. In addition, I agree with the desire of users to have better, more consistent documentation including availability in other languages and would like to work on this. I would also like to create better lesson modules that help students understand and create their own documentation and implement their own testing.</p>
<h3>Look back at your answer to the short-answer question about experience with the various technologies used in App Inventor development. For each technology where you indicated “extensive experience”, write a paragraph explaining your relevant experience. Include links to actual code and documentation that you’ve written.</h3>
<p>Java: I have programmed in Java for about 10 years including 3 years teaching Java as an AP Computer Science A instructor. I have taught and coded complex projects in everything from Greenfoot to GUIs in Netbeans. I competed in programming contests including Cal State Los Angeles’ ProgFest and The Wittry Memorial Programming Contest taking 1st place in my division in both. </p>
<p>Android Development: As a teacher of Computer Science A I piloted the College Board’s WE Service Coursework. I taught students how to create and publish applications aimed at solving local and global problems in Android Studio. These projects ranged from applications that informed users about diabetes, air quality, and drug addiction to apps that interfaced with an arduino and provided medication reminders on bracelets for seniors. My husband and I are currently working on an application using Java, Rest, and MongoDB to track users preferred meals.</p>
<p>Automated Testing: As a teacher and a programming contest organizer I regularly create JUnit tests to automate testing to determine students’ scores. In my Software Development Class we created a functioning web application that relied on over 5000 lines of python logic code to complete the main task and needed to be extensively tested to ensure functionality.</p>

<p>Google App Engine: I participated in Google’s Computer Science Summer Institute at MIT. We were tasked with creating one individual web application and one group web application. My individual application was a multiplayer web based version of the card game set. Our group based game was a computer version of the videogame DDR made in such a way that we could use the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfQqh7iCcOU">MakeyMakey (go to 40 seconds)</a> to play with water buckets. After that experience I used the same technologies to make a prototype of scheduling software for Cal Performances.</p>

<p>Blockly: Honestly I put experience with Blockly because I have used a significant amount of content from blockly apps in different classroom and extracurricular settings. Only after greater research did I realize that the question was probably asking how much experience I had developing using blockly. One of my favorite demos is the graph based blockly as it allowed me to work interdisciplinarily with my students who were often struggling in Algebra.</p>

<h3>Describe what experience you’ve had working with other software developers and/or with large code bases. This can include class projects and an excellent StackOverflow reputation.</h3>
<p>As previously referenced in examples of automated testing. I worked with a team of 5 students over the span of a semester to build a web application that was 60% of our course grade. The reference to StackOverflow definitely brings me back to my undergrad days. I remember using both StackOverflow and StackExchange quite often. Honestly though when it came to being a helpful member of my courses Piazza was where I developed a reputation for always being willing to help. I have developed Java code in groups as a teacher developing free response questions for AP Computer Science A as part of the <a href="http://apcs-collective.com/">AP CS Collective</a>.</p>

<h3>Describe your design for how this would appear to App Inventor users. What new components or properties or methods would you add?</h3>
<h3>Explain how you would implement change. Would you extend the existing Camera component, or would you create a separate component? You should say which files in the source tree would need to be added and modified, and indicate how they would need to be modified, and how the modifications would take advantage of features in the Android SDK. You don’t have to provide running code, but you might want in include a couple of short code snippets at key points. Your explanation should be clear enough that another developer could do the implementation.</h3>
<p>The name pointing out the use of an undocumented, testing feature (CAMERA_FACING) is quite useful as that is the first place to look when a connected feature is no longer working. In looking through the documentation for the Camera I was looking at the YoungAndroidFormUpgrader.java to look at how upgradeCameraProperties() functions and found that the code does not seem to work efficiently as the entire first if statement does nothing to influence outcomes as the second if statement overrides. </p>
<p>
if (srcCompVersion < 2) {
      // The UseFront property was added.
      // No properties need to be modified to upgrade to version 2.
      srcCompVersion = 2;
    }</p><p>
    if (srcCompVersion < 3) {
      // The UseFront property was removed, it is not supported in
      // newer versions of Android
      if (componentProperties.containsKey("UseFront")) {
        componentProperties.remove("UseFront");
        upgradeWarnDialog(MESSAGES.useFrontDeprecated());
      }
      srcCompVersion = 3;
    }</p><p>
    return srcCompVersion;
</p>
<p>In my experience with students they more often than not expect that upon pushing the camera button they will automatically take a picture and are left waiting for feedback from the app when they need to provide the input to take the picture. This leads me to think that not only would the ability to have one input automatically capture the image be useful in creating applications in the way they want but also in removing a point of confusion as the two different options would make it clearer to users. For this reason I would only have one component, Camera, but with two methods instead of the one takePicture() method. I would name them takePictureImmediately() and openCameraToTakePicture(). Both of the new methods will start with the same code as takePicture() in the same place. takePictureImmediately() will need to add the event necessary to automatically trigger the image capture event “(call-component-method 'Camera1 'TakePicture (*list-for-runtime*) '()))”. Not adding another component limits the other changes you need to make but you need to add the methods into the interface to allow users to select and read documentation of each method inside media.md</p>
<p> Another interesting project that would allow student learning associated with camera but much more complex than what is being discussed here would be the implementation of image filters like they are familiar with in social media. This image editing is quite interesting in the PictureLab of the AP Computer Science A curriculum and even basic RGB altering capacities would be a great learning opportunity in App Inventor.</p>
<p>P.S. typos in a comment are definitely not worth the pull request but seeing “// wether or not we have permission to use the camera” made me laugh because that means something totally different.</p>
